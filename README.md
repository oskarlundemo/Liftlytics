# Liftlytics - React & Node.js

## Live demo 

Note that the project spins down with inactivity, so it might take 50 seconds before everything is running

### 💡 What I have learnt 

While building Liftlytics, I strengthened my skills and became more familiar with several modern frontend and backend tools:

React Query – for efficient server-state management, caching, and syncing workout data in real time.

Framer Motion – used to create smooth transitions and animations, making the app feel dynamic and user-friendly.

Recharts – for building interactive data visualizations to track progress and performance trends.

Supabase Auth (OAuth) – for handling secure user authentication and account management.

Axios – as the primary HTTP client for making API requests and integrating with backend services.

This project helped me deepen my understanding of data-driven applications, combining interactive visual feedback with secure, scalable backend functionality.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a fullstack weightlifting exercise logger built to make training more structured and personalized. With this app, users can:

📊 Log sets and reps for each exercise to track workout sessions.

🏋️ Create custom exercises that fit their training style.

🧩 Define custom muscle groups — for example, if only “Legs” exist by default, users can add specific groups like “Glutes” or “Hamstrings.”

📈 Visualize progress over time to stay consistent and motivated.

The goal of this app is to provide a flexible, data-driven training log that adapts to the user’s needs, making it easier to build routines, measure progress, and stay accountable in the gym.
